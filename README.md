# AutoVideoProducer - Developed June 2025

Independent project I made in June 2025 and uploaded July 2025 to Git for archival purposes 

**AutoVideoProducer** is a scalable, multi-channel, AI-driven YouTube Shorts generation and publishing system.

Built in Java + Node.js, it:
- Uses GPT-4o to scrape and summarize trending web content
- Narrates it using OpenAI TTS and transcribes with Whisper
- Clips and syncs background gameplay using FFmpeg
- Renders final videos with Remotion + React
- Uploads to YouTube automatically on a timed loop

## Features include:

- Concurrent channel management (5+ channels)
-  GPT-4o-based story/script generation per channel prompt
-  OpenAI TTS (`shimmer` voice) → MP3
-  Whisper → accurate timestamped transcription for captions
- Remotion (React) → final rendered .mp4
- Upload rotation every 3 hours per channel
- All credentials loaded via environment variables
